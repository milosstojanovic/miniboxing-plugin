newSource1.scala:8: warning: The method head in trait C1 is called from trait C2 using the `super.head` construction. However, after miniboxing, this construction becomes suboptimal, since there is no specialized variant of method head exactly matching the specialization in trait C2. To fix this, make sure that the specializations of trait C2 and trait C1 match exactly.
For more information, please see https://github.com/miniboxing/miniboxing-plugin/issues/73:
  override def head: B = super.head
                               ^
newSource1.scala:7: warning: The trait miniboxing.tests.compile.bug73.ver5.C1 would benefit from miniboxing type parameter B, since it is instantiated by miniboxed type parameter B of class C2.
trait C2[@miniboxed A, @miniboxed B] extends C1[A, B] {
      ^
