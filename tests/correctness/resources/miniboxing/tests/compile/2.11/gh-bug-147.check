newSource1.scala:1: warning: To gain the maximum performance, the miniboxing plugin represents functions (and closures) as described at http://scala-miniboxing.org/example_functions.html. However, `Ydelambdafy:method` uses a different, incompatible and suboptimal function representation. Your program will still compile but PLEASE DO NOT EXPECT THE BEST PEFORMANCE as long as you use delambdafication!
