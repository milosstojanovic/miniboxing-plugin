newSource1.scala:11: warning: Using the type argument "T forSome { type T <: Int }" for the miniboxed type parameter T of class C is not specific enough, as it could mean either a primitive or a reference type. Although class C is miniboxed, it won't benefit from specialization:
  new C[T forSome { type T <: Int }] // => unspecialized C_L
